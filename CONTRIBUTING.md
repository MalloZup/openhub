# Contributing to openhub

openhub is a free software program that welcomes new contributors. If you want
to get involved with this project, here there are some general guidelines:

1. Pick a task:
  - Offer feedback on open pull requests or issues.
  - Create a new issue to start a discussion on a new feature or a potential
    bug.
2. Fork the project, and work on your changes.
3. Rebase your changes agains `master` just to be sure that you are up-to-date.
4. Make sure that your changes do not break the testing suite. As the
   `README.md` file suggests, you can do this by performing the following
   command at the root of the project: `make ci`.
5. Commit your changes, while writing a useful commit message.
6. Submit a pull request with your changes.

And above all, be nice to everyone.
